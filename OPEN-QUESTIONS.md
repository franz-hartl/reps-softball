# Open Questions for R.E.P.S. Owners

Questions that need answers before launch or to improve the site.

---

## Copy Approval

1. **Review the About section copy:**
   ```
   This is a softball facility.

   Nine state championships. Hall of Fame coaches.
   Building tradition.
   ```
   Does "Building tradition." land? Is this the right tone for Milford?

2. **Review the hero sub-copy:**
   ```
   Built by champions. For the next one.
   ```
   Comfortable with "champions"? Too bold, or earned?

3. **"Ready to Work?" card** — good energy or too aggressive?

   - Mentioned on site or kept informal?
