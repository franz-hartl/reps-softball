# R.E.P.S. Decision Rooms

Perspectives to run decisions through before shipping.

---

## The Homepage Room

**For:** Any changes to website copy, layout, or messaging

**The Perspectives:**

- **Mom in the carpool line** — Scanning on her phone between pickups. Does she get it in 3 seconds? Does this feel like a place for her daughter?

- **12-year-old player** — Does this sound like somewhere she'd want to go? Or does it sound like adults talking about her? Is there anything here that makes her feel like she doesn't belong?

- **Suzette or Jeanette** — Does this sound like how we actually talk? Would we say this out loud to a parent at a game?

- **Skeptical travel ball dad** — He's seen a dozen "elite training facilities." What makes this different? Is this real or is it marketing fluff?

- **First-time visitor who's nervous** — She's not sure her daughter is "good enough" for a real facility. Does anything here make her feel unwelcome or intimidated?

**The Tensions:**
- Confident vs. welcoming: We want to sound credible without sounding exclusive
- Softball-first vs. accessible: The differentiator matters, but we don't want to sound like we're bashing baseball
- Coach voice vs. parent-friendly: Direct is good, but not cold

**Use This Room When:**
- Writing or editing any website copy
- Changing the layout or flow of a page
- Adding new sections or features
- Before any push to production

## The First Impression Room

**For:** Hero section, above-the-fold decisions, landing experience

**The Perspectives:**

- **Someone who clicked a Facebook ad** — They have 5 seconds of attention. What do they see? Do they know what this is and what to do next?

- **A mom who heard about R.E.P.S. from another parent** — She's checking it out. Does this match what she heard? Does it feel legit?

- **A player looking over her mom's shoulder** — What does she notice? Does the vibe feel right?

- **Someone comparing facilities** — They've got three tabs open. What makes this one stick? What makes them close it?

**The Tensions:**
- Information vs. simplicity: They need enough to understand, but not so much they bounce
- Personality vs. clarity: "Built different" is the vibe, but they also need to know what this place actually is

**Use This Room When:**
- Touching the hero section
- Changing CTAs or button text
- Adjusting the visual hierarchy
- Deciding what goes above the fold

## The Operations Room

**For:** How-it-works messaging, booking flow, practical information

**The Perspectives:**

- **A parent who's never booked before** — Is it clear what to do? What happens after she clicks? Will someone be there?

- **A returning family** — Can they get in and out fast? Is the booking link easy to find?

- **Suzette at 9pm answering emails** — Will this copy reduce confusion? Or will it generate more "how does this work?" questions?

- **A family who shows up confused** — What did they miss? What should have been clearer?

**The Tensions:**
- Self-service vs. personal touch: The model is independent, but first-timers need hand-holding
- Efficient vs. welcoming: Returning users want speed; new users need warmth

**Use This Room When:**
- Editing the "First Time?" or "Ready to Work?" sections
- Changing anything about the booking flow
- Adding operational details (hours, access, what to bring)
- Writing email templates or auto-responses

## The Brand Room

**For:** Voice, tone, visual identity decisions

**The Perspectives:**

- **A Milford softball parent who knows Suzette and Jeanette** — Does this sound like them? Or does it sound like a marketing agency?

- **A player who trains here** — Would she share this? Does it feel like her place or like her parents' place?

- **Someone who's been burned by overpromising facilities** — Does this feel honest? Or does it feel like hype?

- **A designer looking at the site** — Is it cohesive? Does the visual language match the voice?

**The Tensions:**
- Professional vs. authentic: It should look good, but not corporate
- Aspirational vs. grounded: Inspire, but don't overpromise
- Softball culture vs. broader appeal: Speak to insiders without alienating newcomers

**Use This Room When:**
- Making voice or tone decisions
- Choosing imagery or visual elements
- Deciding whether something fits the brand
- Questioning if copy sounds "too marketing"

## How to Use These Rooms

1. **Before making changes:** Pick the relevant room and read through the perspectives
2. **Run the decision through:** Ask what each perspective would notice, question, or feel
3. **Note the tensions:** If perspectives conflict, you're making a real tradeoff — name it
4. **Ship with confidence:** Once the room has weighed in, trust the decision
