## Strategic Positioning

### What We Are
- **Softball-first facility** — not a baseball facility that "also does softball"
- **Built by women who played** — female instructors who understand fastpitch
- **Community home base** — where younger players watch older players
- **Development-focused** — confidence and character alongside skills

### Who We're For
- Girls who want to get better (not just elite players)
- Parents looking for authentic softball instruction
- Families seeking community, not just transactions
- Tween athletes (9-14) at risk of dropping out of sports

### Key Research Insights
- Girls drop out of sports at 2x the rate of boys by age 14
- 45% quit due to low body confidence
- Parents of female athletes prioritize confidence-building over competition
- Only 22.5% of youth coaches are female — this is our differentiator
- Softball families respond to "community" and "belonging" language

## Voice Guidelines

### Style: Direct Coach Voice with Community Warmth
- Short sentences
- Say what it is
- No cleverness or marketing speak
- Warm but not soft
- Local pride (Milford)

### Do This
- "Her bat and glove" (not "your equipment")
- "Get to work" (not "train")
- "Softball facility" (not "training center")
- Use "fastpitch" to signal authenticity
- Reference the ripple effect — older players inspiring younger ones

### Don't Do This
- "Take your game to the next level"
- "State-of-the-art"
- "Elite" without evidence
- "World-class"
- Baseball-first language
- Exclamation points in headlines
