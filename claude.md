# R.E.P.S. Project Context

## What Is R.E.P.S.?

**R.E.P.S.** = Ripple Effect of Preparation & Sacrifice

A 7,000 sq ft indoor softball training facility in Milford, Connecticut with 6 lanes (4 batting, 2 pitching). Built by women who played, for the girls coming up behind them.

## The Core Positioning

**Tagline:** "Built different."

**"This isn't a baseball facility that also does softball. It's a softball facility."**

This is the differentiator. Everything flows from here. R.E.P.S. is:
- **Softball-first** — Not baseball with softball tacked on
- **Female-led** — Women who played teaching women's mechanics
- **Community-focused** — Not transactional, but a home base
- **Development-focused** — Confidence alongside skills
- **Local roots** — Milford program, Milford families, Milford pride

## Target Audience

- Warm but not soft
- Local pride (Milford)

### Do This
- "Her bat and glove" (not "your equipment")

- Reference the ripple effect — older players inspiring younger ones

### Don't Do This
- "Take your game to the next level"
- "State-of-the-art"
- "Elite" without evidence
- "World-class"

- Exclamation points in headlines

## Core Values

1. **The Ripple Effect** — Growth spreads. A player who puts in the work inspires her teammate. Younger players watch older players.

2. **Development Over Everything** — We care about making players better—skills, confidence, love of the game. The wins follow.

3. **All Are Welcome** — She doesn't need to be elite to train here. She needs to want to get better.

4. **Confidence is the Legacy** — Softball is the vehicle. Confidence is what she takes with her.

## The R.E.P.S. Test

Before publishing any copy, ask:

1. Is it about her, not us?
2. Does it sound like a coach, not a marketer?
3. Is it welcoming to anyone who wants to get better?
4. Would a busy parent get it in 3 seconds?
5. Does it feel like community, not transaction?
