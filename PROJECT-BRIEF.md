# R.E.P.S. Website Project Brief

## What Is This?

A single-page website for **R.E.P.S.** — an indoor softball training facility in Milford, Connecticut.

**Current state:** Single HTML file with embedded CSS. No build step. Works now.

---

## The Core Truth

**"This isn't a baseball facility that also does softball. It's a softball facility."**

Built by women who played, for the girls coming up behind them. That's the positioning. Everything flows from there.

## The Model: Self-Service

1. **First-timers** call or email to get set up
2. **After setup**, book online anytime
3. **On arrival**, swipe in and train independently
4. **No staff on-site** during sessions

This fits the brand: Preparation. Sacrifice. Put in the reps.
